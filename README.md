# grcOS
grcOS stands for "Governance, Risk & Compliance Open Source". Good GRC practices are critical to good customer outcomes in all businesses, but especially those in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare. Laws are generally designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety of people and their belongings. It's important that the tools that help businesses ensure that they are complying with those laws are high quality and freely available. This is what grcOS aims to achieve.
